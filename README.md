# E-Commerce-Site-Featuring-Admin-Tools-and-Security-Filters
Developed a dynamic web application for a virtual plant shop using Node.js, Express, EJS, and SQLite, featuring role-based authentication (USER and ADMIN), a secure shopping cart system, and an admin dashboard for
managing products. The app includes protections against SQL injection and brute-force login attempts, rate-limiting by IP, and responsive user interface elements enhanced with nature-themed emojis. Designed for both
functionality and aesthetics, the project ensures smooth user experience while enforcing access control and security best practices.
